    "Understanding the demand of products is one of the most difficult problems for all businesses that produce physical goods. Even understanding the demand of a single product marketed to a single consumer base can be extremely challenging work. This challenge is compounded when dealing with the variety of products in the variety of markets that Wal-Mart is involved in. Developing a generalizable model that can be used to understand demand could give Wal-Mart a significant competitive edge over competition. An important factors that allowed Wal-Mart to keep its prices competitive and consolidate so many markets was its efficient supply chain. [Profitworks](https://profitworks.ca/small-business-sales-and-marketing-resources/blog/marketing-strategy/579-sam-walton-wal-mart-what-is-wal-mart-s-secret-to-success.html), a marketing agency, credits one of the largest reasons for Wal-Mart's national success as its extremely efficient supply chain. Being able to accurately forecast demand is imperative to efficiently running a supply chain whose supply can consistently meet demand without having an excessive amount of inventory. Keeping all products available and properly managing inventory can be difficult, and it becomes exponentially more difficult when storage bins are cluttered and/or full. Managing this balance, especially in stores with less space for inventory such as Wal-Mart Neighborhood Markets, can demand high levels of precision. "

The calendar.csv file contains the date for every day, as well as the weekday, month, and Wal-Mart week. It also includes information of the days holiday status, and the days when snap is available. The sales_train_validation.csv contains information on the amount of units sold every day for 3019 different products across 10 different Wal-Mart stores in three different states. The sales_train_evaluation data contains the same information as the validation data, along with the correct values for the 28 day forecast. The sample_submission.csv contains an example csv for the format needed to submit the 28 day forecasts. The sell_prices.csv contains the prices at which the items were sold for every Wal-Mart week."

It could be used to predict the next day accurately, but had a serious data leakage issue when forecasting more than one day out, as it used lags that a real model would not have access to. One could create a model that forecasts one day at a time replacing the lags with forecasted lags, but the model would suffer from giving too much weight to the forecasted lags that contain inherent error. I decided only to use lags outside of the range of the forecast. The lag of 28 will also be used to create the baseline model, where the prediction will be the amount of units sold 28 days before. I also made a column that gives the average sales of all the lags which are all the same day of the week. "

As the goal is to forecast sales 28 days out, the lag_28 column for the last 28 days of the time series will be used as a baseline prediction. This gives an average RMSE of 2.06 between all the different products. There is also a baseline model that predicts units sold as the average amount of units sold daily for that item. This gives a better average RMSE of 1.71. A deployable model will need to greatly outperform both of these baseline models."

    "Random Forest Models are often a good place to begin when searching for a good model. They are extremely flexible and often give pretty good results even without hyperparemeter tuning. They also run much faster than many more complex models. In fact they are often quicker than simpler models such as K-Nearest Neighbors. This model ended up seriously overfitting and had an average coefficient of determination below negative one on testing data. It did get an RMSE of 1.83, which beats the first baseline of 2.06, but fails to outperform the second baseline of 1.71. Significant improvement is needed to make this model actually worth implementing. Also, strangely enough, this Random Forest model was actually much slower than the Extreme Gradient Boosted model. The Random Forest algorithm will be left behind as it does not seem to be appropriate for this sort of problem. "

    "Extreme Gradient Boost(XGBoost) is one of the most popular modern machine learning algorithms. It is a common winner of machine learning competitions and has been shown effictive in a vast range of domains. Even using the default arguments of the XGBoost algorithm can often give strong results, and these results can improve greatly when the hyperparameters are tuned. As mentioned earlier, this algorithm, unexpectedly, ran faster than the Random Forest algorithm. However, the results of this model was even worse than the first model with an average RMSE of 1.97, which was almost as bad as the first baseline model. It was also even more overfit than the first model, so the hyperparameters will need to be heavily tuned to get more value out of this."

    "The default max_depth for XGBoost is 3, and generally it is recommended to stay below 10. Typically a max depth of 4-8 is the best parameter for XGBoost, as you need the trees to be weak predictors. I tried reducing the max depth in order to reduce overfit, but it ended up causing underfit. Then I tried increasing the max_depth and bumping up regularization to combat overfitting. This seemed to result in overfit that regularization could not deal with. Increasing regularization did have a good effect, however the max_depth of 3 resulted in the best average RMSE. The RMSE was reduced to 1.47, but the model still has a negative coefficient of determination. Much progress will need to be made before this model is worth deploying. There seems to be too much noise to fit these models, or just as likely, there are too many important variables this model is missing."
